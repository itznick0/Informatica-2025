Andrei() Welcome to the first of many podcasts, I'm Andrei Chiva () in these podcasts we will talk all about games from the oldest of times to the present and maybe even have a look at the future, to begin we will talk about all the different benefits games can bring to people.

Nicola() One benefit can be the fact that you can play while being away from your friends.

Andrea() It also improves your attention to details, your timing and it also shortens your reaction time, furthermore it can distract you so you don't think of bad things that couldve 
happened to you

Sergiu() Other than those things it also improves your memory and you can meet new people from other countries so you can learn more cultures from the different people you meet.

Andrei() I'd say these are amazing things and the fact that you can have a lot of fun with your friend while being far away from eachother is an amazing bonus not many other things have.

Nicola() Guys we forgot about something

Sergiu() What did we forget.

Nicola() The fact that in videogames you can do whatever you want without limitations. for example if you want to build a house there are games that make it able for you to do that or if you want to fight with someone there are also games that make it able to do that

Andrea() That's all for today, thank you all for listening, the second part will be uploaded soon, so stay tuned to follow us and our podcast "No Game No Life"

Andrei() See you next time
