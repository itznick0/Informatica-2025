<p>Safety Issues at School</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the student safety meeting at the school, I decided to compile this report to highlight the two major problems and try to find a solution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The biggest problem encountered is that students from other schools sometimes enter the main building through the garden door. They shouldn't be here, and this can be dangerous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second problem encountered is that some students on the first floor might throw objects at people on the ground floor. This is very dangerous because the objects can seriously injure someone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To address these issues, we should lock or better monitor the garden door. Teachers should also remind students not to throw or drop objects from the upper floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Generally, the meeting did not reveal any other significant issues, and students do not report any safety issues at the school.</p>
